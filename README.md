## First of All, What Is Next.js?

### The React Framework for the Web
Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications with minimal configuration. It enhances standard React by offering built-in features like server-side rendering, static site generation, routing, and API support.
